_Two important points about your Work With Me document:_

1. It's your documentâ€”this is just a starting point to help you in beginning to write it. Feel free to add and
remove sections. Feel free to start with an empty page and fill it out however you'd like.
1. It's meant to be a change with youâ€”update it as frequently (or infrequently) as you'd like.

## Values

### Authenticity

When people, places, things are authentic magic happens.
Authenticity, to me, is about the absense of barriers and superfluous facades.

I believe that finding one's "authentic self" is not always easy, but is a worthwhile endeaver because maintaining an inauthentic image needlessly wastes precious energy.
   
### Ingenuity & Creativity

I am always most impressed by ingenuity and creativity.
The two go hand in hand, forming the basis for idea generation.
Without ideas (good or bad) the result is stagnation, and stagnation is my least favorite state of being.

### Adaptability

We live in a world that necessitates adjusting to change.
Being unable to adapt is a frustrating experience, just like working with inflexible tools is a frustrating experience.
I admire adaptability, and try to always remember to be adaptable myself.

### Empathy

Perhaps most importantly, empathy influences most of the decisions I make.
Where individuals might not share values, empathy is the key to finding mutual understanding, compromise, etc.
Whatever circumstances demand.

## Personality

I tend to be curious by nature.
I like to try to understand things before making judgements about them.
On the flipside, a lack of understanding can lead to paralysis, so finding a balance of understanding "the whole" and taking action is something I often need to practice.

I have a tendency to want to be helpful.
I dislike struggling through anything.
It's the struggle itself that is uncomfortable, and I like to mitigate discomfort for myself and others wherever possible.
I also acknowledge that periods of discomfort can also lead to periods of growth.
The pendulum needs to swing ðŸ˜†



## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Feedback is always appreciated.
While I try not to be fearful of much, one thing I do fear is being on the recieving end of (likely in my view) unjust reaction without being given feedback and a chance to correct.

Positive feedback in any form is always appreciated, though I often don't know what to do with too much public praise.

Negative feedback is also always appreciated, though I appreciate when it is given with care and no more publicly than need be.

## Work Patterns

I usually stick pretty close to a "typical 9-5".
I have flucuated whether I gravitate towards the earlier or later part of that range depending on life circum.
Some flexibility is always appreciated.

Fortunately (and unfortunately) working "enough" hours has never been an issue for me.
I am highly motivated by the idea of having finished tasks.
Combined with a tendency to bite off more than I can chew, I have to be extremely intentional about stopping points and healthy work-life balance norms.

I believe the best work comes out of collaboration and mentorship, so I love to pair on work.
Not being left alone with a task for too long, or working in opportunities to get feedback along the way is extremely valuable.
I also know that single-threaded tasks exist, and I am able to find my happy place plugging away at something on my own for extended periods of time.
I'll certainly shout when I feel like its been to long since I've surfaced for air.

## Communication Preferences

I tend to be responsive to communications in tools like Slack.
Email is something that I find I check more and more infrequently.
Ultimately, a project/workplace typically has a single tool that is predominantly used (if not, that's a problem, IMO), so using that tool will work for me.
I don't often "go dark" for extended periods of time, so folks can expect relatively quick responses. 
If you haven't heard from me by EOD, a gentle nudge doesn't hurt.
If I am swamped and know I can't give you the attention you deserve, I'll try to let you know up front.

## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

If I seem overly anxious or (especially) irritable, that's a good clue that I'm feeling unsafe in some way.
Notably, I might not even consciously recognize it myself!

### How to help

Reminders about what's important, how to sequence things to tackle the most important things first.
A plan for how to dig myself out is always a relief.

## Me Being Me

I appreciate humor and try to find it even in painful circumstances.
I try to be measured with sarcasm, because I know that it can be misinterpreted.
I tend to lean into self-deprecating humor. Don't worry, I'm okay (mostly ðŸ˜œ).

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actionsâ€”but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

### Facilitation silence

If I'm facilitating something, I do appreciate interaction.
Especially in the world of virtual meetings where folks (respectifully) stay muted, it can feel like talking to a wall.
Let me know if you're engaged (or not). React, chime in, post in chat.
Zoom silence is painful for me, and me filling that silence is painful for everyone else ðŸ˜†.

### Multithreading

When it feels like I have too many things that need attention at the same time, I can get overwhelmed.
My workload is not anyone else's problem, so I do try to be transparent when I can't take on something else, but please note that I'm notoriously bad at saying "no".
I dislike that I often do this to myself, but if you need something don't hesitate to ask just because you've read this ðŸ¤ª.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

### Technical prowess

Long term, I have consistently wanted to improve my technical stregths.
I have continually done so, but the depth of an engineering career is limitless, so I suspect this will be a goal of mine until retirement (and we'll see what I get up to then).

### Mentorship

I've enjoyed mentorship opportunities I've had in the past, and believe I'd be effective as a mentor and/or manager as I continue to grow.

## Areas for Development

### Being direct

Being direct is something I could be much better about.
I often spend so much time trying to say something well, or overly gently, that the impact of direct communicaton can get lost.
Some folks appear naturally talented at being direct and consciencious.
If I ever say something that comes of curt, or inconsiderate please know that it's probably just me practicing being direc and falling flat.
Give me feedback when it happens!

### Being quick

I tend to over-analyze because I want to make the best decisions.
This leads to spending a lot of time early on taking wide stabs at a problem.
Fortunately, as a result, I don't often get stuck down a rabbit hole with no way out.
I do, however, often consider that I've strayed too far in the other direction.
Sometimes a good "YOLO" is exactly what is needed.
